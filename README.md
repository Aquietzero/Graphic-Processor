#Simple Grapic Processor#
=========================

Digital Image Processing is one of my most important courses this term. Though the homework is not so difficult, I want to make it better. Hence I am considering to wrap it with a QT GUI so that it can be applied to some simple tasks of image processing. The project is ongoing through the whole term.

#To Do#
=========

1. Keep adding new features and functions in it.
2. Make it more user friendly.
3. Keep reconstructing the code to enhance reusability.
