# Simple Grapic Processor#

Digital Image Processing is one of my most important courses this term. Though the homework is not so difficult, I want to make it better. Hence I am considering to wrap it with a QT GUI so that it can be applied to some simple tasks of image processing. The project is ongoing through the whole term.

I restart the project today since I am going to go over all the things I have learnt in this wonderful and amazing course. Further more, I am going to implement more algorithms and dive deep into a brand new area **Computer Vision**, which is qutie new to me.

# TODO

Refactor the whole project.
